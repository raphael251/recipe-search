This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Recipe Search Project

This project was developed by me, following the tutorial from the [Hamza Mirza's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBV-JvG9Ubkj7AU6Cxls1Tw/videos) (I recommend his channel. It was very helful to me! He teaches very well!).

I change some details, but in the majority, its the same. I've learned a lot about React in this project, especially about the React Router, and how to get data from the API and display it to the client.

I intend to create a new project, to practice the knowledge that I've learned here.

Thanks for the visit!
